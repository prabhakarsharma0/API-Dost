# üöÄ API-Dost: A Smart, Collaborative API Testing Hub

API-Dost is a modern, web-based tool that makes API testing easy, fast, and team-friendly. It combines the power of traditional tools like Postman with real-time collaboration and AI magic. This project is designed to solve real problems that Quality Analysts (QAs) and developers face in their daily workflow.

‚ú® **Main Features**
This tool is much more than just a simple API client. Here are some of its powerful features:

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Team members can work together in the same workspace. When one user saves a new request, it instantly appears on everyone‚Äôs screen‚Äîno need to refresh the page.

- **Environments Management:** You can create different server environments (like Staging, Production) and save separate variables for each (such as URLs, API keys). This makes testing on different servers super easy.

- **AI-Powered Test Generation:** Just tell the AI in plain English or Hinglish what kind of test you want, and it will automatically prepare the full API test (URL, Method, JSON body) for you.

- **AI-Powered Test & Response Analysis:**
  - **Explain Response:** Understand any complex API response in simple language.
  - **Generate Tests:** Let the AI write test scripts (assertions) for any successful response.
  - **Test Automation:** Use the "Run Collection" button to automatically run all your saved tests at once and get a summary report (Passed/Failed).

- **Complete Auth Support:** The tool supports different authentication methods (like API Key, Bearer Token), so you can also test private and secure APIs.

- **History & Import/Export:** All your past requests are automatically saved in the "History" tab. You can also export your entire collection as a JSON file to share with your team.

üõ†Ô∏è **Technology Stack**
This project is built using the latest technology:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript.
- **Backend & Real-Time Database:** Google Firebase (Firestore).
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Google Gemini AI.
